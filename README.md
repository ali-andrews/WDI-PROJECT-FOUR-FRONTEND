##The Baby Bag

For my final project (where I had full autonomy ), I chose to do a MEAN-stack website. <br>

The idea being that many mothers have very little 'free timeâ€™ (often juggling both work and home) when they have babies. Thus my website 'The Baby Bag' is an end-to-end delivery service that enables families to order all of their necessary weekly baby supplies online in few simple steps.
<br> 

I found I utilized Passport for local authentication. The back-end API is run on Heroku and I used Github pages to host the front-end.

###What is The Baby Bag?
The Baby bag is an end-to-end delivery service that enables families to order all of their necessary weekly baby supplies online in few simple steps. Deliveries can be direct to their home, office or a location of their choice. Through this website users can register, sign in and purchase baby food, formula, nappies and other essential baby care products each week. 

###Technology:
The back-end API is run on Heroku and I used Github pages to host the front-end. I used:
* Angular Js, <br>
* NodeJs <br>
* Express <br>
* MongoDB<br>
* JSON Web Token <br>

I found I utilized Passport for local authentication. I also implemented payment by using a simple Stripe payment system for this project.
<br>

### My Creation Process 
These are the wireframes or 'mock-up boards' that we made before creating the site, using Sketch.

###User Stories

I began with a rather ambition plan. Although it was mostly fufilled there are still parts that I would like to implement if I get more time avaliable.

My initial concept:

* A user should be able to see all products without logging in

* A user should be able to see products regardless of whether they are signed in or not- however, when they do by products if they are not signed in there will need to be a 'fast check out process' where I user does not sign up but the details are given.

* A user should be able to see the total of their spend as they shop

* A user should be able to edit their 'cart' with product purchases i.e. delete a product they may not want or add multiple of one product

* A user should be able to see how many items are in her cart whilst shopping

* A user should also be able to save a wishlist- if he/she would like to revist the page later

* Also the products will be categorised and within one catergory will be many different products of it.
<br>
<br>

###Improvements

If I had more time we would have implemented the following features:

* A search bar that can search through the entire site

* Categorize products by product type

* If the user has a regular order automatically had all these products into her cart if she requests it- with the ability for her to modify this at anytime 

* Have a little item display at the top the cart with how many products are in the cart

* Automated chat to suggest or help customers with products and feedback on these products

* Have alternative suggestions with other products the user might also like based on the products they have previously bought
